% Modify this supplied file to assign appropriate values to each of the
% variables, using the expressions provided in the lab notes.

% Assign this variable the value of 1 divided by the square root of 2 pi.
surd = 1 / sqrt(2*pi)

% Assign this variable the value of 5 times 10 to the power of 9 plus
% 3 times 10 to the power of 8.
power = (5 * 10^9) + (3 * 10^8)

% Assign this variable the value of the logarithm (base 10) of 72.
logbase10of72 = log10(72)

% Assign this variable the value of cosine of pi (working in radians).
cosinePi = cos(pi)

% Assign this variable the value of the exponential function with the input
% value 1 (that is e to the power of 1).
eulerValue = exp(1)

% Assign this variable the complext number obtained by taking the natural
% log of the sin of the square of pi.
complex = reallog(sin(pi^2))
